### Abstract

Over the years, the importance of travel has grown. Travel is educational, recreational,
and absolutely essential in todayâ€™s era of globalization. Many technologies are being
implemented to make this travel experience smoother and more accessible around the
globe. Travel booking websites enable us to easily compare different travel plans to
provide most cost- effective solution. This project is aimed at implementing a database
management system to facilitate the process of a tourism website in which users can
plan their future holiday or work trips. Users will have the option to "LOG IN" or
"SIGN UP" using their email-id, phone number and password. The user credentials will
also be stored in the database itself. Users can join pre-existing travel packages after
viewing all necessary details such as detailed itinerary and total cost. Users can also
take a short survey in order to get trip recommendations based on their preferences.
Once the destination is finalized, users can make a booking by providing necessary
details such as current city, meal preferences, accommodation preferences, number of
passengers, Aadhar card number etcetera. After filling in all the details in correct
format, user will be re-directed to an online payment portal in order to complete
payment and finalize booking. The database for this project has been implemented
using MySQL, the backend server-side scripting language used is PHP, and HTMLCSS,
JavaScript have been used for front-end development


### 1.Introduction

- 1.1 Overview

Tourism is a very booming industry and has developed as an important part of
the economic foundation of many countries. People see holidays as a necessity,
and not as a luxury in the present scenario. Tourism calls for coordination and
cooperation between various parameters such as accommodation, mode of travel,
budget for travel, number of travelers, etc.

- 1.2 Motivation

The importance of travel and leisure has been highlighted during these difficult
Covid-19 times. The demand for an easy to use, reliable travel booking website
is bound to increase once the situation returns to normalcy and travel restrictions
are lifted.

- 1.3 Objective

This project aims at implementing a system that helps users to plan and
coordinate their trips in an easy-to-use and reliable manner.

- 1.4 Organization of the project

We will be using MySQL to create the tables and designing a website as our
final presentation in which a user can create travel plans, join pre decided travel
plans and also submit reviews for destinations they have visited along with
filling a survey using which the website will recommend travel destinations to
the user.
